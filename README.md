# MarcBS/keras Multimodal Learning fork

This fork of Keras offers the following contributions:

- Caffe to Keras conversion module
- Layer-specific learning rates
- New layers for multimodal data


Contact email: marc.bolanos@ub.edu

GitHub page: https://github.com/MarcBS


MarcBS/keras is compatible with: __Python 2.7__ and __Theano__ only.

## Caffe to Keras conversion module

This module allows to convert Caffe models to Keras for their later training or test use.
See [this README](keras/caffe/README.md) for further information.

## Layer-specific learning rates

This functionality allows to add learning rates multipliers to each of the learnable layers in the networks. During training they will
be multiplied by the global learning rate for modifying the weight of the error on each layer independently. Here is a simple example of usage:

```
x = Dense(100, W_learning_rate_multiplier=10.0, b_learning_rate_multiplier=10.0)  (x)
```

## New layers for multimodal data

#### Recurrent layers
- [LSTMCond](https://github.com/MarcBS/keras/blob/ba642f5d345983c3ebeffede41c57e03a5c1f7ee/keras/layers/recurrent.py#L940): LSTM conditioned to the previously generated word (additional input with previous word).
- [AttLSTM](https://github.com/MarcBS/keras/blob/ba642f5d345983c3ebeffede41c57e03a5c1f7ee/keras/layers/recurrent.py#L1261): LSTM with Attention mechanism.
- [AttLSTMCond](https://github.com/MarcBS/keras/blob/4e6a8ec8a55bd0d5d091a44b058a797d3d934ce0/keras/layers/recurrent.py#L1642): LSTM with Attention mechanism and conditioned to previously generated word.

#### Convolutional layers
- [ClassActivationMapping](https://github.com/MarcBS/keras/blob/4e6a8ec8a55bd0d5d091a44b058a797d3d934ce0/keras/layers/convolutional.py#L23): Class Activation Mapping computation used in [GAP networks](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04150.pdf).
- [CompactBilinearPooling](https://github.com/MarcBS/keras/blob/4e6a8ec8a55bd0d5d091a44b058a797d3d934ce0/keras/layers/convolutional.py#L1395): compact version of bilinear pooling for [merging multimodal data](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01847v2.pdf).
