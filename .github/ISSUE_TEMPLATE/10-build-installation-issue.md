Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/keras

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug, a feature request, or a significant problem with the documentation (for small docs fixes please send a PR instead).
The form below must be filled out.
Here's why we have that policy: Keras developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

**System information**.  

- Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in Keras):   
- OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):   
- TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):   
- TensorFlow version (use command below):   
- Python version:   
- Bazel version (if compiling from source):   
- GPU model and memory:   


**Describe the problem**   
Describe the problem clearly here. Provide the exact sequence of commands / steps that you executed before running into the problem

**Source code / logs**.  
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
